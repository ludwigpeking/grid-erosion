## Description

The study deals with two problems:
### The Traffic Pattern in the Grids
Firstly, it simulates the spontaneous traffic patterns emerging within the grid, the value creation and growth patterns that arise in response to the spantaneous movements of inhabitants. 
### The Erosion of the Grids
Secondly, it delves into the grid's deterioration due to factors such as economic downturns or sociopolitical upheavals, highlighting the subsequent movement reorganization. Notably, informal occupations following these disturbances play a pivotal role in reshaping the city.
